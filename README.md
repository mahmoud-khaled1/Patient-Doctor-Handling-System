# Patient-Doctor-Handling-System
This project aims to develop a doctor patient handling, managing system that helps doctors in their work and also patients to book doctor appointments and view medical progress. The system allows doctors to manage their booking slots . Patients are allowed to book empty slots and those slots are reserved in their name. The system manages the appointment data for multiple doctors for various date and times. Each time a user visits a doctor his/her medical entry is stored in the database by doctor. Next time a user logs in he may view his/her entire medical history as and when needed. At the same time a doctor may view patients medical history even bore the patient visits him.
